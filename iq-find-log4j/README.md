# find-log4j
This is a sample script to search all applications that have been scanned by Lifecycle for the log4j-core components.

## Requirements
Developed for python 3 using the component requests.

## Directions
You will need to update the script with the base url for your IQ Server.  You will also need to update the username and password in the script before running.

The script will output the applications where log4j is found to the console as well as a results.json file.  Feel free to adapt the output to your needs.
